Cricket is a popular outdoor sport played between two teams of eleven players each.
It originated in England and is now widely played in countries like India, Australia,
England, Pakistan, and South Africa.

The main objective of cricket is to score more runs than the opposing team.
One team bats while the other team bowls and fields.
Runs are scored by hitting the ball with a bat and running between two wickets.

A cricket match is played on a circular or oval-shaped field with a 22-yard pitch at the center.
The pitch contains two sets of three wooden stumps called wickets.
The bowler delivers the ball towards the batsman, aiming to dismiss the batsman.

There are different formats of cricket:
Test Cricket is played over five days.
One Day Internationals (ODIs) consist of 50 overs per side.
Twenty20 (T20) cricket is the shortest format with 20 overs per side.

Common ways a batsman can be dismissed include being bowled, caught, run out, or leg before wicket (LBW).
Famous cricketers include Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, and Kapil Dev.

Cricket is not just a sport but a passion for millions of fans around the world,
especially in India where it is followed with great enthusiasm.
